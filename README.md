# Problem-Set-2
 2nd Problem set for EP-353
Aaron Wolff
for EP-353-FA2019
I've included ProblemSet 2.1, ProblemSet 2.2, ProblemSet 2.3, and ProblemSet 2.4.

Due on Friday Sep 27, 2019

I learned how to use AND and OR, the scanf function, and other math operations. With this assignment, I was able to practice writing values to char, int, and float variables, as well as evaluate expressions for within.

Problem 2.1 was challenging because of the necessity to use a bitwise 'AND' to detect the 32 number offset in uppercase and lowercase letters in the ASCII table. 
I compared the input to 0010 0000.

In Problem 2.2 I was able to use the pow function, but only after I learned how to temporarily convert an integer to a float for the sake of an expression using (float).
